## Overview

Welcome to the Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website, created as part of the Codecademy curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering Path. 

This project contained a series of open ended requirements. I was expected to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources to solve any problems I encountered.

I built a club group page that dynamically responds to screen size adjustments.


## Features
- **Flexbox**: I used flexbox to design different sections of the website.
- **Color Palette**: I used a color palette that I created to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.
- **Font Combination**: I put together font-families that go well together and complement the overall website and are appropriate for the company. Used Google Fonts.
  ### **Responsive design tools**:
- @media rule to change layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Used relative rem unit



## Status
- Complete for now.
- Will test on Iphone 13 Pro Max for size.
- Will check to see if I need to make any changed from pixels to percentages.

## Languages

- **Html**
- **CSS**
